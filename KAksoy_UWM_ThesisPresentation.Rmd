# Research Question

- Modern autocracies use different methods to maintain power.

- The appearance of competence is a key componentâ€”how do they create this image?

- What is the relationship between the cost of repression and low-level bribery?

# Theory

- Informational autocracy [@guriev2019] leads to subtle means of repression, smart tactics to pre-empt dissent.

- Corruption unpacked: Bribery and embezzlement/theft as separate concepts.

- Petty bribery (e.g., traffic police, DMV clerk) impacts citizen perceptions severely.

- Autocrats who cannot repress will seek to decrease low-level bribery as a means of creating an image of competence.

# Hypotheses

- As cost of repression rises, low-level bribery will decrease.

- As regime legitimation on performance grounds rises, low-level bribery will decrease.

# Data and Design

- Primarily Varieties of Democracy [@vdem2023] data, some reinforcement with other data sets.

```{r descriptive-statistics}
datasummary((`Low-level bribery` = v2excrptps) +
              (`Physical violence index` = v2x_clphy) +
              (`Performance legitimation` = v2exl_legitperf) +
              (`Electoral democracy index` = v2x_polyarchy) +
              (`GDP per capita` = e_gdppc) +
              (`Time required to open business (days)` = businessdays) +
              (`Natural resource income as % of GDP` = naturalresourcerents) ~
              (Mean + SD + Max + Min + N), # Capital letters are important, these default na.rm = T
            data = df1,
            output = 'kableExtra') %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = 6)
```

- Sample is formed from all autocracies, defined by their "electoral democracy index" score (less than 0.42).

- Unit of analysis is the country.

- Linear regressions, clustered standard errors to correct for autocorrelation between country-units.

# Findings

- Statistically significant relationship between political violence and low-level bribery.

- Less significant relationship between performance legitimation and low-level bribery.

- Null for H$_1$ rejected; null for H$_2$ is more difficult to reject.
